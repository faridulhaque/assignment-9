* This website included 6 routes: Home, Dashboard, Review, Blog, About and the last one for showing error message. 
* The Home page has a picture in its right side and some text including a name and some info in the left side. In the bottom part of the page is containing three reviews made by the users. 
* DashBoard page is showing statistics data with two charts vertically. The one in top is a Line chart and another one is a Bar chart
* The Review page shows six reviews from the users with their comments. Six reviews are in six different cards placed with three columns and two rows. 
* There is a hidden page which I named as Notfound is to show an error message if someone tries to enter in a page which does not exist in the website. And a page you will see named 'about' which has nothing in it but a simple message, just ignore it.    

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
